# Uber-Data-Analysis-Project

You have the uber drive data for a driver which captures the different aspects of driving behavior. You are a part of the project where you need to grill this data and report the important findings from the grilling and drilling exercise. You also need to provide some useful insights about the trip behaviour of a Uber driver. Let us try to dive into the data with pandas and numpy by our side!

## Dataset -

- [Uber data](https://github.com/Rahul1097/Uber-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/master/uberdrive.csv)

The dataset contains-

- Start Date - the date and time of the start of the trip
- End Date - the date and time of the end of the trip
- Category (Business/Personal)
- Start Location - starting location of the trip
- End Location - location where the trip ended
- Miles Driven - Total miles driven between the start and the end of the trip
- Purpose of drive - Purpose of the trip (Meals, Errands, Meetings, Customer Visit etc.)

## Objective-

The aim is to answer some questions about the driver behavior while exploring the data.

## Uber Data Analysis based on below questions

- Name and number of all the unique start and stop points
- Popular start and stop points
- Rides with same start and stop points
- Starting point from which most miles have been driven
- Start- stop pairs that are most travelled in terms of distance and number of trips
- Busiest month in terms of number of drives and miles driven
- Busiest day of the week and preferred start hour
- Peak hours
- Most frequent trip category
- Most frequent trip purpose
- Miles driven per category and purpose
- Percent composition of business miles vs personal miles
- Time spent per category and purpose
